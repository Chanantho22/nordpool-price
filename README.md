# NordPool Curent Price

Fetches NordPool electricity prices from Elering and displays the current price for the Baltic countries in their correct time zone.

[Deployed here](https://nordpoolprice.codeborne.com/)

Useful if your electricity bill is tied to the exchange spot price, so you can decide when to charge your electric car, etc.
